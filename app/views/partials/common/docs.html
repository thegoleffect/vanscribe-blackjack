  <h1>&#x2663; Blackjack</h1>
  <h4>Instructions</h4>
  <p>Click a table name to join (if seats open)</p>
  <p>Red circle opens action menu</p>
  <p>H = Hit, St = Stand, D = Deal</p>
  <p>Click the (i) to go back to Lobby</p>
  <br/>
  <h4>Rationale</h4>
  <p class="strikethrough">Best played using an iPhone.</p>
  <p>(Or shrink the width of your browser for maximum effect)</p>
  <p>This game was designed, built, &amp; deployed over a week to demonstrate a wide range of artistic and technical skills... but ends up being an embarassing beta.  Nevertheless, I got to learn some cool things and the bugs will eventually go away.</p>
  <p>In addition to being a showcase, I forced myself to learn several new things at the cost of time (and possibly health). Some of these cool toys are listed in the Colophon.</p> 
  <p>A few of the more annoying Bug List parts will get fixed now that it is live... but most likely after a power nap.</p>
